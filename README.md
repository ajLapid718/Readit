# README

A clone of Reddit. First app deployed to Heroku. This helped me to develop slightly more familiarity with differences in development and production. I also became more familiar with Heroku commands in the terminal as well as using SO to determine what was deprecated and what was not between different versions of Rails. I learned a little bit about the Bootstrap framework as well as HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery. This also helped me work with constantly tracking files and committing (descriptively) and pushing. This is also one of the first READMes I am purposefully filling out. Became familiar with the concept of dyno hours as well. Became comfortable with editing the gemfile. Need to brush up on branches and merging branches. Learned about scaffolding as well.

* Small victories:
  - Became familiar with GitHub Markdown
  - ctrl + shift + f
  - developed intuition on which folders I needed to navigate to
  - learned more terminology here and there
  - btn group

  ```ruby
  the_front_page_of_the_internet = "reddit!"
  print the_front_page_of_the_internet
  ```
